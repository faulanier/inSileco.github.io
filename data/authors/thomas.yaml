project: "Human activities induce multiple stressors that organisms have to
cope with in their natural habitats. However, monitoring global change
effects is often investigated independently without accounting for potential
synergy among them. The aim of my PhD is to disentangle the relative influence
of habitat degradation (agricultural intensification, urban sprawl) and
pollution on the breeding performance of three cavity nesting birds. Up to
600 nest boxes spread across an urban-rural gradient in the Lower
Saint-Laurent area are monitored annually since 2014 through a citizen
science program. Passive atmospheric samplers were deployed along this
gradient to map the contaminants. Our objectives are to compare nest
occupancy, breeding performance (phenology, clutch size, growth rate) and
physiological performance (metabolic rates, stress levels) of birds in
different physical and chemical habitats. Several experimental studies will
further demonstrate the relative impact of pesticide exposure and chronic or
acute stress on nestlings’ development and energetic performance in these
common birds."
