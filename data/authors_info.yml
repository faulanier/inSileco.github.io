  project: "The intensification of the human footprint in marine ecosystems imposes the use of a systematic planning approach for the use of marine resources. There is, however, currently little knowledge on how multiple stressors interact to affect the integrity of ecosystem structure and functions. My PhD project focuses on evaluating cumulative anthropogenic impacts on the structure of the communities of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada.
The specific goals of my thesis are to:
1. Evaluate cumulative impacts on the ecosystems of the St. Lawrence,
2. Characterize the spatial structure of the communities of the St. Lawrence,
3. Evaluate the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple stressors, and
4. Evaluate cumulative impacts on the communities of the St. Lawrence from the cartography of stressors (Obj. 1) and communities (Obj. 2), as well as the vulnerability of communities to multiple stressors (Obj 3)."

  project: "Biogegraphy aims at unravelling the causes of species geographic
  repartitions and including them in an integrativ theory. Species interact in
  many ways which affects their demographic variables which in turn affect their
  probability of being present in a particuliar site. Therefore species
  interactions are likely to affect their distribution. In order to better
  understand how interactions affect species repartitiion:

  1. I develop theoretical frameworks to genereate new hypotheses,    
  2. I try to verify (or not) by analysis large ecological datasets.

  project: "It is well known that climate change will modify the distribution of trees over the coming decades and many studies have already showed responses for some species. However, the potential of forest management to mitigate climate change impacts on forest dynamics remains poorly understood. The overall goal of my PhD is to develop a decision-make tool to improve management strategies that take climate change into account. I will build a model that represents forest dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales, and the effect of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The model will be parametrized from a forest inventory database and we will focus on tracking uncertainty using Bayesian methods. By quantifying trees migration rate under climate change in different forest management scenarios, we expect to find a positive effect of forest management on accelerating forest migration towards the north. In addition, we expect a better understanding of the synergetic interactions between human actions and forest dynamics."
