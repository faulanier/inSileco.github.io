## About the posts

Here is the exhaustive list of R packages we use to generate this website. Therefore it includes all the packages (*i.e.* CRAN and Github packages) required to generate all our blog posts.
We do our best to keep this list as short as possible. To do so, we do not include packages that will be installed as a dependency. For instance, we may use several functions of the *raster* package but as *biomod2* depends on in, we did not include *raster* in the list (it will be installed with *biomod2*).

To make future updates easier, we used the following [gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/):
