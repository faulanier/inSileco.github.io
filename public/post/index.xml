In comes blogPostSeriesName!
blogPostSeriesName is a series of blog posts that each present 5 – hopefully helpful – coding tips for a specific programming language.
Posts should be short (i.e. no more than 5 lines of code, max 80 characters per line, except when appropriate) and provide tips of many kind: a function, a way of combining of functions, a single argument, a note about the philosophy of the language and practical consequences, tricks to improve the way you code, good practices, etc.</description>
