      <description>Code tips you said? Ever tumbled on a code chunk that made you say: “I should have known this ¶ø?!@~:&amp;amp; piece of code long ago!”? Chances are you have, frustratingly, just like we have, and on multiple occasions too.
In comes blogPostSeriesName!
blogPostSeriesName is a series of blog posts that each present 5 – hopefully helpful – coding tips for a specific programming language.
Posts should be short (i.e. no more than 5 lines of code, max 80 characters per line, except when appropriate) and provide tips of many kind: a function, a way of combining of functions, a single argument, a note about the philosophy of the language and practical consequences, tricks to improve the way you code, good practices, etc.</description>

      <description>All authors of this blog are ecologists and modelers and therefore inclined to write blog posts related to both ecology and modeling. As modelers, we use various computational tools. However, given the current prevalence of R among ecologists, we tend to write more about R than other programming langages. This website it-self is been built with Rmarkdown which is a very convenient way to write about R.</description>
